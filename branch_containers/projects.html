        <h4 class="project_date">March 2016 - Present</h4>
        <p class="project_paragraph">The beginning of the Backyard remodel. The first part took about 1 and 6 months. If you remove winter; it looks more
        like 7 months. The Rv1 contains the finished retaining wall where the new fence is on. The front yard looks like a mud
        pit. The weeds started to be less of a problem and think of another bandage.<p>
        <p class="project_paragraph"> I do have a side-project that will help better my home without spending a large amount of money.
        All I have to do is read some books and do some R&D. I will have my Bathroom done with the fancy tech and modern and with my own built software system.</p>
