            <p class="Summary_Paragraph">My main goal is to become a software engineer one day. I started to learn all
                this skills because I noticed that a partiality curious subconscious of myself wanted to know more. I
                took a shot, almost two years later. I'm have a enough skill and knowledge to take this on my own terms.
                I have left IKEA to start dog sitting will praticing computer science and to build a repution for myself
                for tech and what I can do.
